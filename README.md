Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.7+
- A code editor (e.g., VS Code or PyCharm)
- A browser (for running the frontend)

---

### Steps to Set Up the Backend

1. *Navigate to the Backend Folder*
    bash
    cd backend
    

2. *Create a Virtual Environment*
    - *Linux/macOS*:
      bash
      python -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate
      
    - *Windows*:
      bash
      python -m venv venv
      venv\Scripts\activate
      

3. *Install Required Python Packages*
    bash
    pip install flask flask-cors flask-sqlalchemy
    

4. *Set Up the Database*
    - Initialize the SQLite database:
      bash
      python
      >>> from app import db
      >>> db.create_all()
      >>> exit()
      
    - This creates a database.db file for task storage.

5. *Run the Backend Server*
    bash
    python app.py
    
    The backend will run on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

### Steps to Set Up the Frontend

1. *Navigate to the Frontend Folder*
